<h2>Authorization</h2>

<p>The API uses <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth2</a> for 
authorization. To access protected parts of the API you need to obtain an access
token. Therefor you can use the following endpoints:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Authorization-Endpoint</dt>
    <dd><code>/developer/auth</code></dd>
    <dt>Token-Endpoint</dt>
    <dd><code>/authorization/token</code></dd>
</dl>

<b>Authorization Code Grant</b>
<p>For the authorization code you have to redirect the resource owner to the 
consumer endpoint:<br><code>/auth?response_type=code&client_id=[app_key]&redirect_uri=[url]&scope=authorization</code>. 
If the authorization was successful the user gets redirected to the <code>redirect_uri</code>
of your app. The <code>redirect_uri</code> contains a GET parameter code which 
can be exchanged for an access token at the Token-Endpoint.</p>

<b>Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant</b>
<p>Through the resource owner password credentials grant you can obtain an 
access token with your app credentials and the username/password of your 
account. Therefor you can send directly an request to the Token-Endpoint 
containing the app credentials and you username and password.</p>
