<h2>Welcome,</h2>

<p>this is a quick introduction to help you get started using this API. On the 
left sidebar you see all available documentation resources. To access protected
parts of the API you can read the <a href="./documentation/authorization">authorization</a>
guide. On the <a href="./documentation/support">support</a> page you can see all
available support options if you get stuck.</p>

<p>The API <a href="./api">reference</a> lists all available endpoints. It is 
the main entry point to explore the capabilities. All supported request methods
are shown in a tab navigation. There you can see the request and response 
format. The format is a html representation of the JSON format. Each property 
refers to a property in the JSON object.</p>
