# Fusio Developer

This repository contains the Fusio developer Angular app which allows you to easily on-board
external developers by providing a fronted where external developer can register to consume
your API. All content of this app can be customized at the Fusio backend under the Consumer / Page
panel. More information about Fusio at:
https://www.fusio-project.org

This app is a starting point which our users can use in case there is no existing portal.
If you already have an app it is also possible to integrate all functionality of this app
into your existing app. Please take a look at our [SDK overview](https://www.fusio-project.org/sdk)
which helps to integrate Fusio into your existing app. You can also take a look at our
[samples overview](https://www.fusio-project.org/samples) where we provide some demo
integrations.
